# Scraping-Automation

The purpose of this repository is to showcase how webscraping can be used to automate tasks. These can be tasks I have automated for work related or personal reasons.

The scripts are not particularly pretty, but they do get the job done easily and can save a lot of time compared to doing stuff like this by hand.
